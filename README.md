# metapa
The metaPA model is Markov model for the dynamics of a spatially extended ecosystem.  It is an extension of the PA model, described in Fisher and Mehta (2014) and Dickens, Fisher, and Mehta (2016).  "PA" stands for "Presence/Absence", meaning that this model only accounts the presence or absence of species, not their abundances.

This repository contains Python code for the simulation and analysis of the metaPA model.
